# React Native Starter

This is a basic seed repository to demonstrate a React Native codebase.

## Prerequisites

First see this link in the React Native docs to set up your environment for your desired development platforms:

[React Native Docs - Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

Stop once you reach the section titled "Testing your React Native Installation".

## Installation

To install application dependencies for this project, open the terminal, `cd` to the application root, then run:
`npm install`

This will install all Node.js modules required for development

## Usage

Running the application in the respective platform simulators is done via 2 commands:

`react-native run-ios`
and
`react-native run-android`

### Hot Reloading

Once the application has opened in the simulator, press `Cmd + D` and enable hot reloading. This allows the app to update in the simulator any time the underlying JavaScript files change.

Note: In order to run the app in the iOS simulator, you must be on a Mac and have Xcode installed. To run the android emulator, you must have Android Studio installed have a valid Virtual Device configured ([More info](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#2-install-the-avd-and-haxm)).
